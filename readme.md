# JobTrackers - Unit 4 - GA

# Link to HEROKU Deployment:

## What is JobTrackers
JobTrackers allows a job seekers to organize their job search in one convenient place. It is designed, developed, and deployed as a full-stack MERN Web App from 2 Sofware Engineering Immersive students in Seattle, WA.

## Team Members

* Ari Greif (Git Master)
* Josh Hunter

## Foundation

JobTrackers is built with React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It features React Hooks and it incorporates API Axios fetches, CRUD methods, and RESTful routing best practices.

## User Experience, wireframing, project flow

We agreed that our users who need to organize their job search would want the ability to: 
* Signup/Login
* Add a new job they are interested in
* Indicate whether they have submitted an app, included a resume, attached a cover letter, contacted a recruiter, and conducted an introductory interview
* Upon submission, the user easily sees and updates their job search progress
* That data persists throughout the app and renders onto the homepage into an appealing and organized format


Our project began with some initial User Flow, User Experience, and Whiteboard planning

And throughout the planning process, we trimmed the unnecessary routes and settled on a gameplan:

## Development Log

5-day timeframe from project launch to deployment. 

We spent first days planning. This included whiteboarding, developing schemas for Mongoose, deciding which elements of React we wanted to feature(hooks), and routing.  We worked together to compile the api server file as both developers understood the importance of finishing the backend. See photos above to observe the process.

Pivot Day - Of most importance was getting the bearer token to pass through successfully into separate components, without it, we were struggling to gain quick traction on our React pages. Also, we implemented a string of Boolean conditions into the relationship models, rigged them with checkboxes so the user could toggle between checkmarks... This proved harder to implement than originally planned. It took some strategizing, refactoring, and consulting with other developers. Mission Accomplished however. With the completion of those bullets, we now sit at 80 % MVP
