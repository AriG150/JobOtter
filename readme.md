## Team Members

* Ari Greif (Git Master)
* Josh Hunter

## Foundation

JobTrackers is built with React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It features React Hooks and it incorporates API Axios fetches, CRUD methods, and RESTful routing best practices.

## User Experience, wireframing, project flow

We agreed that our users who need to organize their job search would want the ability to: 
* Signup/Login
* Add a new job they are interested in
* Indicate whether they have submitted an app, included a resume, attached a cover letter, contacted a recruiter, and conducted an introductory interview
* Upon submission, the user easily sees and updates their job search progress
* That data persists throughout the app and renders onto the homepage into an appealing and organized format

Our project began with some initial User Flow, User Experience, and Whiteboard planning:
